Hypothesis Testing and Theory Evaluation
================

The dominant approach to evaluating theories of politics quantitatively
often takes the form of *hypothesis testing*. Despite its persistence in
the field, the most common manifestation, Null Hypothesis Significance
Testing (NHST), is plagued by logical inconsistencies that remain poorly
understood. This week we will look at the basic logic of hypothesis
testing in political science, the questions it can and cannot answer,
and alternative approaches that are better suited to answering the
questions social scientists are interested in.
