Quasi-Experimental Designs I
================

In many if not most cases in political science and economics, baseline
random assignment of the treatment is either impractical or infeasible
due to ethical, financial, or other considerations. Faced with this
reality, social scientists often rely on quasi-experimental approaches
to estimate causal effects. This week we will explore alternatives to
experimental designs that attempt to achieve baseline random assignment,
their core assumptions, and some of their limitations focusing on
difference in difference and regression discontinuity designs in
particular.
