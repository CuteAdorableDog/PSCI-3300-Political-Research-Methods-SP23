At the most basic level, a theory is a verbal or formal explanation 
that describes a causal relationship between two or more variables. That is, a 
theory is our proposed answer to the question of why and how some phenomena 
occurs; a data story about why we think a causal relationship such as $Race \longrightarrow Vote~Choice$ or $Federalism_{j[t]} \longrightarrow Conflict_{j[t+1]}$ exists. This week we look at what makes a good theory, different ways of 
verbally and formally expressing theoretical relationships, and making 
explicit connections between research question, theory, and data.
