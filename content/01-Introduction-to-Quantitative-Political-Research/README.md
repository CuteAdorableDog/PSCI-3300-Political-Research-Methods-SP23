Introduction to Quantitative Political Research
================

As a discipline, political science consists of the empirical study of
social and political phenomena. Yet, how we ought to study these
phenomena is a contested subject with divides between descriptive
analyses, causal inference, and prediction having long animated the
discipline. In the first week of this course, we will begin by
considering various approaches to contemporary political inquiry, the
questions they are capable of answering, and their respective
trade-offs.
