Advanced Topics in Political Methodology
================

We’ve covered a great deal over the course of the semester, focusing
mainly on strategies for causal inference and probabilistic reasoning.
To conclude this course, we’ll briefly turn our attention to a somewhat
different inferential goal and discuss the use of predictive modeling
and machine learning in the quantitative social sciences. Topics include
extensions of leave-one-out cross-validation, multilevel regression and
post-stratification, and sensitivity analysis.
