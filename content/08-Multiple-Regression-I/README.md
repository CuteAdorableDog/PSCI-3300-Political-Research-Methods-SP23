Multiple Regression I
================

Regression models are ubiquitous in political science and serve as the
primary workhorse for statistical inference. This week we will continue
our introduction to the foundations of applied statistics in political
science and the use of regression as an approach to estimating and
describing relationships. We’ll also more concretely discuss the
assumptions necessary for valid inference.
