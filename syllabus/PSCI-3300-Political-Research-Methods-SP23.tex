\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

\noindent This course serves as an introduction to research methods,
causal inference, and applied Bayesian statistics for contemporary
political research. Throughout the semester, we will cover formulating
research questions, theory development, the logic of causal
relationships, and approaches to answering questions about political
phenomena. Although there is a modest amount of statistics involved,
this is fundamentally an applied course where students will gain
experience applying a range of different approaches to analyzing,
visualizing, and interpreting data using the open-source statistical
programming language R and the tidyverse. In practice, that means less
of this

\[\mathrm{Normal}(y|\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\, \sigma} \exp\left( - \, \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y -\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)\]
\noindent and more hands-on stuff like this

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Simulate 10,000 random draws from a standard normal distribution}
\NormalTok{std\_norm }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{rnorm}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{n =} \FloatTok{10e3}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{mean =} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{sd =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{\# Print a summary}
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(std\_norm)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Upon completion of this course, students should be able to understand
and interpret most research published in political science journals, as
well as public opinion polls, surveys, and research findings reported in
the news. Students will formulate theoretical arguments and identify
their testable implications, evaluate causal claims in principled and
logically consistent ways, and provide vague answers to precise research
questions. As a result, students who complete this course should be
prepared for future coursework in the social sciences, pursuing their
own research, and for a life as an educated and informed citizen.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\section{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

\noindent Students who master the content of this course will be able
to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Understand and interpret quantitative research published in political
  science journals
\item
  Formulate political research questions and theories to explain causal
  relationships
\item
  Compile data and conduct empirical analysis to answer a research

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{required-course-materials}{%
\section{Required Course Materials}\label{required-course-materials}}

\noindent There is one \textbf{required} textbook for this course which
is available \href{https://theeffectbook.net/}{for free online} or may
be purchased in physical format from the UNT campus bookstore or Amazon

All additional readings for the course and various instructional
resources for applied statistics and programming in R are provided via
the course's Canvas page.

\hypertarget{course-expectations}{%
\section{Course Expectations}\label{course-expectations}}

\noindent A university course is a joint endeavor between instructor and
students. We all have an important part to play. As the instructor in
this course, I am responsible for

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Providing course materials that will give you the opportunity to
  achieve our course objectives and providing you with the tools to
  learn
\item
  Providing timely feedback on your work and explaining concerns you may
  have with grading, and, being fair in my implementation of rules and
  policies in the course.
\end{itemize}

As a student in this course, you are responsible for

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Reading and completing all requirements of the course in a timely
  manner. Students are expected to come to class having done the
  assigned reading and failure to do so is likely to have an adverse
  impact on your grade in this course.
\item
  Working to remain attentive and engaged in the course
\item
  Assisting in maintaining a positive learning environment for everyone.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{technical-requirements}{%
\section{Technical Requirements}\label{technical-requirements}}

\noindent To complete the required assignments for this course you will
need a stable internet connection and access to a laptop or desktop
computer to view course materials on canvas and complete required
assignments. If you have difficulty meeting this requirement, you can
access the internet from any building on the UNT campus or a local WIFI
hotspot. If you encounter technical difficulties please contact the UNT
helpdesk for assistance

\begin{raggedright}
Student Helpdesk:\\
UNT IT Helpdesk\\
Sage Hall 130\\

helpdesk@unt.edu
\end{raggedright}

I assume a basic familiarity with high-school algebra and a working
knowledge of computers. If you are unfamiliar with downloading and
installing software programs on your Mac or PC, \textbf{you will need to
allocate additional time to make sure those aspects of the course go
smoothly.} Note that installing the R language requires
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html\#What-machines-does-R-run-on_003f}{a
modern version of Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux} and \textbf{the Chrome OS
operating system, tablets, mobile devices, and Windows ARM64 are not
supported.} Detailed instructions on installing R and RStudio can be
found on the course's Canvas page.

If you are unable to meet the installation requirements for R on your
personal computer, I have made arrangements to ensure the latest
versions of R, RStudio, and RTools are installed on the computers in the
Political Science Lab in Wooten Hall 173. Unfortunately, I cannot
guarantee that recent versions of R, RStudio, or RTools are installed or
available at other locations on the UNT campus. Note certain features
and packages we use in this course may be unavailable under older
versions of R or RStudio.

\hypertarget{communication}{%
\section{Communication}\label{communication}}

\noindent The teaching assistant for this course and I are available via
email or during office hours to answer any questions you may have about
the course. I typically respond to emails within 48 hours Monday-Friday.
If you send an email over the weekend, we cannot guarantee a response
before Monday morning. Before reaching out, please double check that
your question is not answered somewhere on the syllabus or
Canvas--\textbf{we will not respond to inquiries that can be answered by
simply reading the syllabus}.

In the event you need assistance related to some issue in R, be sure to
attach a script containing all code necessary to reproduce the problem
and a brief explanation of ways you have attempted to resolve it. You
may also seek assistance from the
\href{https://learningcenter.unt.edu/}{UNT Learning Center} or the
\href{https://discord.gg/ggm9dnAYBE}{dedicated R discord channel}.

\hypertarget{course-requirements-and-grading}{%
\section{Course Requirements and
Grading}\label{course-requirements-and-grading}}

\noindent It is extremely important that you read all materials before
the assigned dates and attend class or view the lecture to understand
how the readings from research articles complement material from the
textbook. Additional materials may be posted to Canvas as circumstances
arise. Grades for the course will be based upon assignments, a research
project and presentation, and class participation.

In calculating your final grade for this course I use standard
mathematical rounding but will otherwise make no further adjustment of
grades. Please remember that your final grade is the culmination of work
you have done over the course of the semester. It is not the product of
bargaining at the end of the term. Moreover, I cannot make an exception
for one student without making it for all students and that is never
practical. The University of North Texas relies on an A-F scale for
grades and, taking into account basic rounding, each letter grade
corresponds to the following range:

\begin{center}
A: 89.5--100;
B: 79.5--89.4;
C: 69.5--79.4;
D: 59.5--69.4;
F: 59.4 or Less 
\end{center}

\hypertarget{problem-sets}{%
\subsection{Problem Sets}\label{problem-sets}}

\noindent To get hands on experience writing R code, manipulating and
modeling data, and thinking through the logic of cause and effect, you
will complete a series of sets that ask you to apply the topics we cover
in class using real or simulated data. These will account for 30\% of
your overall grade. Note that \emph{you must demonstrate you have made a
good faith effort to work through each question in order to receive
partial credit for incorrect answers}. Instructions for problem sets 0
through 4 will be posted on the course's Canvas page at least two weeks
before their respective due dates and the approximate subject of each
and tentative due dates are listed in the table below.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{PSCI 3300 Problem Sets}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[htp]{lcc}
\toprule
Assignment & Topic & Due Date\\
\midrule
Problem Set 0 & Getting Started with R and Markdown & January 29th\\
Problem Set 1 & Data Wrangling and Visualization & February 19th\\
Problem Set 2 & Probability and Descriptive Statistics & March 5th\\
Problem Set 3 & Regression and Inferential Statistics & April 2nd\\
Problem Set 4 & Strategies for Causal Inference & April 23rd\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\subsection{Final Project}\label{final-project}}

\noindent The final project for this course requires students to develop
a research question relevant to political science or public policy,
identify the necessary source(s) of data, and undertake an analysis in R
to answer the question using the data and the tools we cover in this
course. The final project will consist of two components, a research
paper and a final presentation, and will account for 40\% of your
overall grade. \textbf{This is a group project and you will need to form
groups of no more than 2-4 people no later than the due date for the
research question assignment.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Research Design} The research paper portion of the final
  project accounts for 70\% of the final project grade and will be
  broken down into four separate assignments: a research question and
  brief overview of the \textbf{political science literature} on your
  topic, a theory outlining the causal relationship of interest, the
  research design, and a final draft combining each of these. Detailed
  instructions for each assignment and examples of what the content and
  structure are expected to resemble will be provided on the course's
  Canvas page.
\item
  \textbf{Final Presentation} The presentation portion accounts for 30\%
  of your final project grade and requires you to give an 10-12 minute
  presentation of your research project which should cover your research
  question, theory, and research design. Examples and templates to
  assist you with structure and preparation will be provided on the
  course's Canvas page.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{midterm-exam}{%
\subsection{Midterm Exam}\label{midterm-exam}}

\noindent The midterm exams will be administered online at the time
specified in the course schedule section of the syllabus. The midterm
exam will account for 20\% of your overall grade in the course.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Questions on the exams will be drawn from both the readings and the
  lectures. Answers should refer to the readings, content, and arguments
  discussed in class.
\item
  Makeup exams will be given only for \textbf{documented absences}, with
  the exception of extended medical problems or family emergencies.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%
\subsection{Class Participation}\label{class-participation}}

\noindent The remaining 10\% of your grade in this course consists of
participation. This means showing up to class, asking relevant
questions, and completing occasional in-class activities.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity-and-plagiarism}{%
\section{Academic Integrity and
Plagiarism}\label{academic-integrity-and-plagiarism}}

\noindent The University of North Texas takes academic integrity very
seriously and
plagiarism--\href{https://guides.library.unt.edu/plagiarism/home}{presenting
the ideas or content of someone else as your own without providing
proper attribution}--of any kind is unacceptable. Proper attribution is
expected on all assignments where necessary and should conform to the
\href{https://connect.apsanet.org/stylemanual/}{citation format of the
American Political Science Association}.

Penalties for plagiarism depend on the severity and will be decided on a
case-by-case basis but may range from a 0 for the offending assignment
to an automatic failing grade in the course. We will cover how to
provide proper attribution, general citation formatting, and how to
automatically generate a references section that conforms to APSA style
guidelines in the second week of class. All work should be your own and
\textbf{submitted assignments will be checked for plagiarism using
TurnItIn.}

To ensure students are aware of proper citation practices to avoid
plagiarism, I require all students complete the
\href{https://www.indiana.edu/˜academy/firstPrinciples/index.html}{University
of Indiana's online tutorial and certification}.Upon completion of the
tutorial, you will take the certification test for undergraduate college
students and submit proof of your certification to the TA through the
assignment on Canvas. \textbf{You must successfully complete and submit
certification before the due date for the research question assignment
on Sunday, February 12th. Failure to submit certification by this date
will result in 20-point deduction for each subsequent assignment until
certification has been submitted and points deducted will not be awarded
retroactively.}

Research}\label{introduction-to-empirical-political-research}}

\noindent As a discipline, political science consists of the empirical
study of social and political phenomena. Yet, how we ought to study
these phenomena is a contested subject with divides between descriptive
analyses, causal inference, and prediction having long animated the
discipline. In the first week of this course, we will begin by
considering various approaches to contemporary political inquiry, the
questions they are capable of answering, and their various trade-offs.

social groups are disproportionately represented in policy outcomes and
why such inequalities arise. This week's focus will be on formulating
and narrowing an empirical research question. We will also cover how to
survey existing research on a subject effectively and efficiently using
Google Scholar and other resources.

Science}\label{theory-building-in-political-science}}

\noindent At the most basic level, a theory is a verbal or formal
explanation that describes a causal relationship between two or more
variables. That is, a theory is our proposed answer to the question of
why and how some phenomena occurs; a data story about why we think a
causal relationship such as \(Race \longrightarrow Vote~Choice\) or
\(Federalism_{j[t]} \longrightarrow Conflict_{j[t+1]}\) exists. This
week we look at what makes a good theory, different ways of verbally and
formally expressing theoretical relationships, and making explicit
connections between research question, theory, and data.

century statistics. Although randomized controlled trials (RCT) are
often held up as the gold standard for research design, they are not
without limitations. This week we'll explore the basic logic of
experimental design in the context of both traditional and natural
experiments, ways random assignment can go wrong, and the trade-off

Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), is plagued by logical

with this reality, social scientists often rely on quasi-experimental

alternatives to experimental designs that attempt to achieve baseline
random assignment, their core assumptions, and some of their limitations
focusing on difference in difference and regression discontinuity

\subsection{Quasi-Experimental Designs
II}\label{quasi-experimental-designs-ii}}

\noindent The approaches to estimating causal effects we've examined
thus far rest upon the assumption of \emph{strict exogeniety} which
tends to fail spectacularly in the context of observational data and
inhibits our ability to make causal claims outside of experimental
settings. This week we turn our focus to recent developments in
political science that draw on a set of weaker identifying assumptions
known as \emph{sequential ignorability} to identify treatment effects
and examine causal mechanisms. We'll also cover alternatives to
difference in difference designs that relax the parallel trends
assumption.

\noindent We've covered a great deal over the course of the semester,
focusing mainly on strategies for causal inference and probabilistic
reasoning. To conclude this course, we'll briefly turn our attention to
a somewhat different inferential goal and discuss the use of predictive
modeling and machine learning in the quantitative social sciences.
Topics include extensions of leave-one-out cross-validation, multilevel
regression and post-stratification, and sensitivity analysis.

\hypertarget{course-policies}{%
\section{Course Policies}\label{course-policies}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Canvas:} Canvas is an online course information and management
  program. All course documents (syllabus, assignments, etc.) will be
  posted on or via Canvas. You should check it regularly, and read all
  of the announcements carefully. Canvas also facilitates e-mail
  communication among class members and between class members and the
  instructor. Please use your UNT email address for communication about
  this class and check it frequently. If you do not you could miss
  important course information.
\item
  \textbf{Late Work, Illness and Family Emergencies:} It is expected
  that all work will be submitted at the scheduled times. \textbf{Late
  assignments will be docked 10\% per day} after missing the deadline.
  \textbf{After 3 days they will not be accepted.} If you are unable to
  turn in work on time because of an emergency, you must contact me
  prior to the deadline. All illnesses and family emergencies must be
  documented with appropriate evidence.
\item
  \textbf{COVID-19:} While completing work is expected as outlined
  above, it is important for all of us to be mindful of the health and
  safety of everyone in our community, especially given concerns about
  COVID-19. Please contact me if you are impacted due to a related issue
  regarding COVID-19. It is important that you communicate with me prior
  to being late as to what may be preventing you from completing your
  work so I may make a decision about accommodating your request to turn
  in late work. If you are experiencing cough, shortness of breath or
  difficulty breathing, fever, or any of the other possible symptoms of
  COVID-19
  (\url{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html})
  please seek medical attention from the Student Health and Wellness
  Center (940-565-2333 or
  \href{mailto:askSHWC@unt.edu}{\nolinkurl{askSHWC@unt.edu}}) or your
  health care provider.
\item
  \textbf{Americans with Disabilities Act Statement:} The University of
  North Texas makes reasonable academic accommodation for students with
  disabilities. Students seeking reasonable accommodation must first
  register with the Office of Disability Access (ODA) to verify their
  eligibility. If a disability is verified, the ODA will provide you
  with a reasonable accommodation letter to be delivered to faculty to
  begin a private discussion regarding your specific needs in a course.
  You may request reasonable accommodations at any time, however, ODA
  notices of reasonable accommodation should be provided as early as
  possible in the semester to avoid any delay in implementation.
\end{itemize}

Note that students must obtain a new letter of reasonable accommodation
for every semester and must meet with each faculty member prior to
implementation in each class. Students are strongly encouraged to
deliver letters of reasonable accommodation during faculty office hours
or by appointment. Faculty members have the authority to ask students to
discuss such letters during their designated office hours to protect the
privacy of the student. For additional information, refer to the Office
of Disability Access website at \url{http://www.unt.edu/oda}. You may
also contact ODA by phone at (940) 565-4323.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Academic Misconduct:} Academic Integrity is defined in the UNT
  Policy on Student Standards for Academic Integrity. Any suspected case
  of Academic Dishonesty will be handled in accordance with the
  University Policy and procedures. Possible academic penalties range
  from a verbal or written admonition to a grade of ``F'' in the course.
  Further sanctions may apply to incidents involving major violations.
  For policy and procedures:
  \url{http://facultysuccess.unt.edu/academic-integrity}.
\item
  \textbf{Emergency Notification \& Procedures:} UNT uses a system
  called Eagle Alert to quickly notify you with critical information in
  an event of emergency (i.e., severe weather, campus closing, and
  health and public safety emergencies like chemical spills, fires, or
  violence). The system sends voice messages (and text messages upon
  permission) to the phones of all active faculty staff, and students.
  Please make certain to update your phone numbers at my.unt.edu. Some
  helpful emergency preparedness actions include: 1) ensuring you know
  the evacuation routes and severe weather shelter areas, determining
  how you will contact family and friends if phones are temporarily
  unavailable, and identifying where you will go if you need to evacuate
  the Denton area suddenly. In the event of a university closure, your
  instructor will communicate with you through Canvas regarding
  assignments, exams, field trips, and other items that may be impacted
  by the closure.
\item
  \textbf{Acceptable Student Behavior:} Student behavior that interferes
  with an instructor's ability to conduct a class or other students'
  opportunity to learn is unacceptable and disruptive and will not be
  tolerated in any instructional forum at UNT. Students engaging in
  unacceptable behavior will be directed to leave the classroom and the
  instructor may refer the student to the Center for Student Rights and
  Responsibilities to consider whether the student's conduct violated
  the Code of Student Conduct. The university's expectations for student
  conduct apply to all instructional forums, including university and
  electronic classroom, labs, discussion groups, field trips, etc. The
  Code of Student Conduct can be found at www.unt.edu/csrr. In short,
  please be considerate of others.
\item
  \textbf{Sexual Discrimination, Harassment, \& Assault:} The University
  has procedures in place that aim to be aware of the needs of those who
  make an institutional report of sexual assault, domestic violence,
  dating violence, and stalking. Procedures include informing
  individuals about their right to file criminal charges as well as the
  availability of counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy,
  legal assistance, visa and immigration assistance and other services
  on and/or off campus, as well as additional remedies to prevent
  contact between a complainant and a respondent, such as housing,
  academic, transportation and working accommodations, if reasonably
  available. The University will make such accommodations, if the victim
  requests them and if they are reasonably available, regardless of
  whether the complainant chooses to report the crime to the UNTPD or
  local law enforcement.
\end{itemize}

Anyone can report prohibited conduct by notifying the Dean of Students
Office (940.565.2648), the Title IX Coordinator (940.565.2759) or the
UNT Police Department (940.565.3000). The online reporting form is found
at \url{http://report.unt.edu}.

\subsection{Important Notice for F-1 Students taking Distance Education
Courses}\label{important-notice-for-f-1-students-taking-distance-education-courses}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Federal Regulation:} To read detailed Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement regulations for F-1 students taking online courses, please
  go to the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations website at
  \url{http://www.ecfr.gov/}. The specific portion concerning distance
  education courses is located at Title 8 CFR 214.2 Paragraph
  (f)(6)(i)(G). The paragraph reads: (G) For F-1 students enrolled in
  classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of
  one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or
  quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if
  the class is taken on-line or through distance education and does not
  require the student's physical attendance for classes, examination or
  other purposes integral to completion of the class. An on-line or
  distance education course is a course that is offered principally
  through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission
  including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or
  satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1
  student's course of study is in a language study program, no on-line
  or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a
  student's full course of study requirement.
\item
  \textbf{University of North Texas Compliance:} To comply with
  immigration regulations, an F-1 visa holder within the United States
  may need to engage in an on-campus experiential component for this
  course. This component (which must be approved in advance by the
  instructor) can include activities such as taking an on-campus exam,
  participating in an on-campus lecture or lab activity, or other
  on-campus experience integral to the completion of this course. If
  such an on-campus activity is required, it is the student's
  responsibility to do the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Submit a written request to the instructor for an on-campus
    experiential component within one week of the start of the course.
  \item
    Ensure that the activity on campus takes place and the instructor
    documents it in writing with a notice sent to the International
    Student and Scholar Services Office. ISSS has a form available that
    you may use for this purpose.
  \end{enumerate}

  Because the decision may have serious immigration consequences, if an
  F-1 student is unsure about his or her need to participate in an
  on-campus experiential component for this course, s/he should contact
  the UNT International Student and Scholar Services Office (telephone
  940-565-2195 or email
  \href{mailto:internationaladvising@unt.edu}{\nolinkurl{internationaladvising@unt.edu}})
  to get clarification before the one-week deadline.
