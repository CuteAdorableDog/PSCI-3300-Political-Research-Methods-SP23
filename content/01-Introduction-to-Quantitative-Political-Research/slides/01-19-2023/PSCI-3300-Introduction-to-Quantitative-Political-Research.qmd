## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

::: incremental
-   **Quantitative Social Science** is the use of quantitative data to study, analyze, or predict social and political phenomena

-   Outside of academic settings, this is more commonly known as *data science*

    -   The logic of quantitative social inquiry we will cover in this class is applied in academic social sciences, government, non-profits, and in the private sector

-   This course introduces students to the logic of causal inference and the tools quantitative social scientists use to study social, political, and economic phenomena

## Why Take this Course?

::: incremental
-   PSCI 3300 is a required course for political science majors so you'll have to take it at some point

-   The skills taught in this course are standard across an increasing number of industries and fields of research

    -   A basic knowledge of statistics, programming, and quantitative reasoning prepares you for a range of future career opportunities or graduate school

-   Contemporary political science is a primarily quantitative field

    -   Understanding the tools of the trade will help you critique the things you read in your other classes

-   The world is full of people who will try to sell you bullshit. This course is designed to help you distinguish between fact and fiction.

## Teaching Philosophy

::: incremental
-   Math for the sake of math is an unfortunately common but largely unproductive way to teach quantitative social science

-   A college-level course in fundamentals of computer programming or elementary statistics may be helpful but is not required

-   I assume you can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and have a basic understanding of order of operations

    -   I guarentee many of you will prove me wrong

-   Our focus in this course will be on how to apply, interpret, and evaluate analyses in political science

-   This course is taught from a primarily Bayesian perspective
:::

## Teaching Philosophy

-   Though there is some elementary statistics required, in practice that means far less of this $$\text{Normal}(y|\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\, \sigma} \exp\left( - \, \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{y -\mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)$$

-   And more hands-on stuff like this

```{r, echo=TRUE}
## Simulate 10,000 random draws from a standard normal dist
std_norm <- rnorm(n = 10e3, mean = 0, sd = 1)

## Print a summary
summary(std_norm)
```

## Structure of the Course

::: incremental
-   Part I: Fundamentals of Political Research

    -   Research questions, surveying literature, basic logic of cause and effect, theory building, and measurement

-   Part II: Foundations of Quantitative Social Science

    -   Foundations of applied statistics, probability theory, Bayesian inference, and applied regression

-   Part III: Research Design and Causal Inference

    -   Experimental design, hypothesis testing and theory evaluation, strategies for causal inference with observational data, and the limits of magical thinking
:::

## Required Course Materials

::: incremental
-   There is one required textbook for this course which can be purchased from the UNT campus bookstore or Amazon

    -   Huntington-Klein, Nick. 2022. [*The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality*](https://theeffectbook.net/). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press. ISBN: 9781032125787

-   Although it is not required, I also recommend obtaining a copy of

    -   Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. *Regression and Other Stories*. Cambridge University Press, 2021. ISBN: 9781107676510

-   All additional readings for the course are provided via Canvas
:::

## Technical Requirements

::: incremental
-   To complete the requirements for this course you will need access to a laptop or desktop computer with a stable internet connection

-   I assume you have a working knowledge of computers including

    -   How to download, save, move, and locate files

    -   How to install software on your computer

-   If you do not have access to a personal computer that meets the minimum requirements necessary to run R, you can access both R and RStudio from computers on the UNT campus

    -   The computers in the political science lab in Wooten Hall 173 should have the most recent version of R, RStudio, and RTools

-   If you expect to have difficulty meeting the technical requirements for this course **you need to let me know immediately**
:::

## Class Meetings

::: incremental
-   Tuesday/Thursday from 12:30-1:50 PM

-   Part of our course time will be spent on lecture and answering questions and the other half will be spent working with data in R

-   You should come to class having done the readings on the syllabus for that day so we can discuss anything that isn't clear or appears confusing

    -   This is not a course you can skate through without ever reading anything and **if you try to do this you will very likely fail**.

-   It should go without saying, but **do not come to class if you are sick**
:::

## Problem Sets

-   You will complete five problem sets which will account for 45% of your overall grade and ask you to apply the things we cover in class using real or simulated data

```{r}
    ## Tibble of the assignemnts and Due Dates

      ) |>
      kableExtra::kable_material()
```

## Midterm and Final Exams

::: incremental
-   The midterm and final exams will be administered online at the times specified in the course schedule section of the syllabus.

    -   The midterm exam will account for 25% of your grade while the final accounts for 15%
    
    - Questions on the exams will be drawn from both the readings and the lectures.
:::

## Course Participation

::: incremental
-   Remaining 15% of your grade is course participation

-   Showing up to class, asking relevant questions, and completing occasional in-class activities

-   Gives me wiggle room to pad grades at the end of the semester
:::

## Additional Details

::: incremental
-   Citations are expected to conform to the style of the American Political Science Association

-   Zero tolerance policy for plagiarism of any kind

    -   Penalties range from a 0 for a specific assignment to an automatic failing grade in the course depending on severity

-   We will cover how to automatically generate citations and manuscripts in the correct format and keep track of sources in class next Tuesday
:::

## Getting Started with R

::: incremental
-   Detailed instructions for installing R, RTools/Xcode, RStudio, and configuring Stan are provided on the course's Canvas page

-   We will also make use of the probabilistic programming language *Stan* via it's R interfaces `brms` and `rstanarm` during parts of this course

-   If you have difficulty getting these installed on your personal computer please come by one of our office hours or make an appointment for assistance

-   First problem set due **Sunday, January 29th** to verify you have successfully completed these installations

    -   We will go over how to successfully complete it in class on Tuesday
:::

## What Should You do This Week?

::: incremental
-   Read the full syllabus for more details about the course and important deadlines

-   Follow the instructions on Canvas for installing R, RStudio, and Stan

    -   We will go over any issues you have getting these installed on Thursday
